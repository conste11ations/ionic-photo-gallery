# ionic-photo-gallery
Photo Gallery react app built in Ionic.
Based off of this [tutorial guide](https://ionicframework.com/docs/react/your-first-app)
Powered by [Ionic React](https://ionicframework.com/docs/react) (web app) and [Capacitor](https://capacitor.ionicframework.com/) (native app runtime).

# How It Works
After the user navigates to Tab 2 (Photos), they can tap/click on the camera button to open up the device's camera. After taking or selecting a photo, it's stored permanently into the device's filesystem. When the user reopens the app at a later time, the photo images are loaded from the filesystem and displayed again in the gallery. The user can tap on a photo to be presented with the option to remove the photo.
